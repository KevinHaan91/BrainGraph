# BrainGraph

#### Overview

<img width="500" src="screenshot.jpg" />

This is an Arduino library used to read and visualize EEG brainwave data. It is designed to manipulate the data from a modified MindFlex EEG headset using an Arduino, and display it visually on a TFT LCD shield.

This project was created using an Arduino UNO, a modified MindFlex EEG Headset, and a Seeed 2.8" TFT Touch Shield v1.0. The BrainGraph library was specifically designed to run on an Arduino UNO, so it is optimized to use the least amount of memory possible. It should work with any Arduino however, with minimal changes, if any.

The BrainGraph library itself does not rely on any additional libraries, however, the example Arduino file has a couple different library dependencies in order to function.
